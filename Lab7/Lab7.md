# Lab 7


we got the basci working
we can pick images, project them, apply the detecor, recognize the homography
the issues si a bit in the stitching
out solution shows some artifacts, which couold probably be removed with a nother passage 
or we could use Bruno's Moethind and skip the homgraphy data and just use half the image
