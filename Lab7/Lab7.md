# Lab 7
**Write a C++ class for stitching a set of images  - i.e., creating a panorama by mergin together a set of images.**

THis was not easy, a lack of clear information on how to do this in practice, an overabundance of resources focusing only on python but an almost complete lack fo documentation on a pure C++ solution were all issues.

In the end a decent solution was found usgin both the professor's hints and some good online resources to adapt into a working code, although issues of some double stitches remain.
More time and effort would be needed to get a perfect result.

Moving the code to a class form was actually quite easy, compared to writing it in the first place.
